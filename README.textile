h4. help

<pre>
  $ cuporter -h

  Usage: cuporter [options]
  
      -r, --report [tag|feature|tree]  View, or type of report.
                                           Default: "tag"
            
      -f, --format [xml|html|csv|text] Output format.
                                           Default: text (it's pretty, though!)
            
      -i, --input-dir DIR              Root directory of *.feature files.
                                           Default: "features"
       
                                           Used to build the glob pattern '[--input-dir]/**/*.feature', which is really most likely
                                           "features/**/*.features" and finds all feature files anywhere under "features" or
                                           your custom root supplied with this option.
                                           Overridden by "--file-input'.
            
      -I, --file-input FILE            Single *.feature file.  Full name with extension, like 'path/to/file.feature.'
                                           Overrides "--input-dir" and used mostly for testing.
            
      -o, --output-file FILE           Output file path, like 'tmp/cucumber/tag_report.html'.
            
      -t, --tags TAG_EXPRESSION        Filter on tags for name report.
                                           TAG_EXPRESSION rules:
                                               1. $ cucumber --help
                                               2. http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/wiki/Tags
            
      -T, --title STRING               Override report default title, which is different for each view/report.
                                           This affects the xml 'report' node title and the html head > title attributes.
            
  Reporting options: on by default but can be turned off:
  
          --no-sort                    Do not sort tags, features, scenarios, or outlines
          --no-number                  Do not get or show scenario or example numbers, (i.e., do not number the leaf nodes).
          --no-total                   Do not get or show totals
          --no-show-tags               Do not show cucumber tags at the feature, scenario, or outline level.
          --no-show-files              Do not show feature file paths.
          --no-leaves                  Show features only, with no scenarios or outlines.

h3. Dependencies

# Nokogiri 1.4.4 or above
** For all things Nodular: XML document building and XSL transformation into HTML
** Not tested on earlier versions yet but I'd guess you'll be fine with anything recent.
** @libxml2@ and @libxslt@ are required by this gem, which *should* handle them smoothly.  However, @libxml@ and cousins
can at times present installation difficulties in the form of clashes with already-installed C resources.  It has to do with very specific
lib versioning and installation order issues.  It's not always the same problem,
so there's no prescription for it but Google, unfortunately.
# jQuery and jQueryTreeview
** packaged with the gem
** jquery.treeview relies on image files, so our tree view requires the HTML to link to its resources rather than copying them to the &lt;head&gt;.

h3. Acknowledgements

* Acknowledgements remain due to the Cucumber HTML formatter, and to the human one, too!.
* Thanks to everyone involved in Nokogiri, jQuery and the Treeview plugin.

  I used to _"Consider this a stop-gap until we get this functionality in a proper cucumber formatter"_, but now I'm not so sure.  Megalomania?
